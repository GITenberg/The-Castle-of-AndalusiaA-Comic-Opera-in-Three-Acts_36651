<h2>
    REMARKS.
</h2>

<p>
A reader must be acquainted with O'Keeffe on the stage to admire him in
the closet. Yet he is entitled to more praise, in being the original
author of a certain species of drama, made up of whim and frolic than
numberless retailers of wit and sentiment with whom that class of
readers are charmed, who are not in the habit of detecting plagiarism.
</p>
<p>
From Operas, since the Beggar's Opera, little has been required by the
town except music and broad humour. The first delights the elegant, the
second the inelegant part of an audience; by which means all parties
are gratified.
</p>
<p>
Had O'Keeffe written less, his reputation would have stood higher with
the public; and so would that of many an author beside himself: but
when a man makes writing his only profession&mdash;industry, and prudent
forecast for the morrow, will often stimulate him to produce, with
heavy heart, that composition which his own judgment condemns. Yet
is he compelled to bear the critic's censure, as one whom vanity has
incited to send forth crude thoughts with his entire good

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>[4]</span>

                                                           will, and
perfect security as to the high value they will have with the world.
</p>
<p>
Let it be known to the world, that more than half the authors who come
before them thus apparently bold and self-approved, are perhaps sinking
under the shame of their puerile works, and discerning in them more
faults, from closer attention and laudable timidity, than the most
severe of their censurers can point out.
</p>
<p>
These observations might be some apology for this Opera, if it required
any. But it has pleased so well in representation, that its deserts as
an exhibition are acknowledged; and if in reading there should appear
something of too much intricacy in the plot, or of improbability in the
events, the author must be supposed to have seen those faults himself;
though want of time, or, most likely, greater reliance upon the power
of music than upon his own labour, impelled him gladly to spare the
one, in reverence to the other.
</p>
<p>
The songs have great comic effect on the stage; particularly those by
some of the male characters: and the mistakes which arise from the
impositions of Spado are highly risible.
</p>
<p>
As the reader, to form a just judgment on "The Castle of Andalusia,"
should see it acted; so the auditor, to be equally just, must read it.

us immortal as the rosy god.&mdash;Fire!

<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Ay, captain, this is noble firing&mdash;Oh, I love a volley of
grape-shot.&mdash;Are we to have any sky-light in our cave?

then I knock him down.

colour is a coward's blood?

cavaliers!&mdash;But this scar on my forehead contradicts the miscreant.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Scar on your forehead!&mdash;Ay, you will look behind you, when you
run away.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> I'll stab the villain&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>Draws Stilletto.</i>]</span>&mdash;I will, by Heaven.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> Pho, Sanguino! you know when a jest offers, Spado regards
neither time, place, nor person.

<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> You know, cavaliers, when I entered into this noble
fraternity, I boasted only of a little courage sharpened by necessity,
the result of my youthful follies, a father's severity, and the malice
of a good-natured dame.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Captain, here's a speedy walk-off to old women.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> When you did me the honour to elect me your captain, two
conditions I stipulated:&mdash;&mdash;Though at war with the world abroad, unity
and social mirth should preside over our little commonwealth at home.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Yes, but Sanguino's for no head&mdash;he'll have ours a commonwealth
of fists and elbows.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> The other, unless to preserve your own lives, never
commit a murder.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> I murdered since that&mdash;&mdash;a bishop's coach-horse.
</p>
<p>
<i>All.</i> Ha! ha! ha!

a dish of olives.
</p>
<p>

thought on; a rich old fellow, one Don Scipio, has lately come to
reside in the castle on the skirts of the forest&mdash;what say you to
plunder there?
</p>
<p>

pistoles&mdash;The morning before his departure, Don Fernando calls me into
his closet, and shutting the door, "Spado," says he, "you know this
obstinate father of mine has engaged me to marry a lady I have never
seen, and to-morrow, by his order, I set out for Don Scipio, her
father's castle, for that purpose; but," says he, striking his breast
with one hand, twisting his mustaches with the other, and turning up
his eyes&mdash;"if, when I see her, she don't hit my fancy, I'll not marry
her, by the&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;I sha'n't mention his oath before you, madam.

<p>

of a valet, in a suit of my clothes, and he shall personate me at Don
Scipio's castle, while I, in a livery, pass for him&mdash;If I like the
lady, I resume my own character, and take her hand; if not, the deceit
continues, and Pedrillo weds Donna Victoria, just to warn parental
tyranny how it dares to clap up marriage, without consulting our
inclinations."
</p>
<p>
<i>Isab.</i> Here's a discovery! so then, it's my poor child that must have
fallen into this snare&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Well, good sir.

this Don Scipio's family; to cover our designs, let it be a secret that
you belong to me, and I sha'n't seem even to know you&mdash;You'll easily
get a footing in the family (says he) by imposing some lie or other
upon a foolish woman, I'm told, is in the castle. Dame Isabel I think
they call her."

the deceit, only to see how the fellow acts his part; he'll play the
gentleman very well, I'll warrant; the dog is an excellent mimic; for,
you must know, ma'am, this Pedrillo's mother was a gipsy, his father a
merry andrew to a mountebank, and he himself five years trumpeter to a
company of strolling players.

<h3>
SCENE I.
</h3>
<p class="scene">
    <i>An antique Apartment in the Castle.</i>
</p>
<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Don C&aelig;sar</span>, with Precaution.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> Thus far I've got into the castle unperceived&mdash;I'm
certain Sanguino means the old gentleman a mischief, which nature bids
me endeavour to prevent. I saw the rascal slip in at the postern below;
but where can he have got to! <span class="dir-i">[<i>A sliding Panel opens in the Wainscot,
and <span class="sc">Sanguino</span> comes out.</i>]</span> Yes, yonder he issues, like a rat or a
spider.&mdash;How now, Sanguino!
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> Captain Ramirez!
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> On enterprize without my knowledge! What's your business
here?
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Sang.</i> Revenge! Look&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>Shows a Stilletto.</i>]</span> if I meet Don Scipio&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> A stilletto! I command you to quit your purpose.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> What, no satisfaction for my wound last night, and lose my
booty too!
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> Your wound was chance&mdash;Put up&mdash;We shall have noble booty
here, and that's our business&mdash;But you seem to know your ground here,
Sanguino?
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> I was formerly master of the horse to Count D'Olivi, the last
resident here, so am well acquainted with the galleries, lobbies,
windings, turnings, and every secret lurking place in the castle.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> I missed Spado at the muster this morning&mdash;did he quit
the cave with you?
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Without.</i>]</span> As sure as I'm alive, it's fact, sir.&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> Isn't that Spado's voice?
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> Impossible!
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> Hush!
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>They retire.</i>
</p>
<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Don Scipio</span> and <span class="sc">Spado</span>.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> Yes, I've heard of such places; but you say you have been
in the cave where these ruffian banditti live?
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Most certainly, sir: for, after having robbed me of five
hundred doubloons, the wicked rogues barbarously stripped, and tied me
neck and heels, threw me across a mule, like a sack of corn, and led me
blindfold to their cursed cavern.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> Ah, poor fellow!
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> There, sir, in this sculking hole the villains live in all
manner of debauchery, and dart out upon the innocent traveller, like
beasts of prey.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> Oh, the tigers! just so they fastened upon me last night,
but your sham Fernando, and I,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>[33]</span>

                               made them run like hares; I gave him my
purse for his trouble.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> And he took it! what a mean fellow!&mdash;you ought not to have
ventured out unarmed&mdash;I always take a blunderbuss when I go upon the
road&mdash;the rascal banditti are most infernal cowards.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> What a glorious thing to deliver these reprobates into
the hands of justice!
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Ah, sir, 'twould be a blessed affair&mdash;Oh, I'd hang them up
like mad dogs!
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> Well, you say you know the cave?
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Yes, yes, I slipped the handkerchief from my eyes and took a
peep, made particular observations of the spot; so get a strong guard,
and I'll lead you to the very trap-door of their den.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> 'Egad, then we'll surprise them, and you'll have the
prayers of the whole country, my honest friend.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Heaven knows, sir, I have no motives for this discovery but
the public good, so I expect the country will order me a hundred
pistoles, as a reward for my honesty.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> Here's a pretty dog!
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Apart.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> Ay, ay, he ha'n't long to live.
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Apart.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> An hundred pistoles!
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Sir, have an eye upon their captain, as they call him, he's
the most abandoned, impudent profligate&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>Suddenly turning sees <span class="sc">C&aelig;sar</span>,
who shows a Pistol.</i>]</span> Captain did I say? <span class="dir-i">[<i>Terrified.</i>]</span> Oh, no; the
captain's a very worthy good-natured fellow&mdash;I meant a scoundrel, who
thinks he ought to be captain, one Sanguino, the most daring, wicked,
and bloody villain that&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>Turning the other may, perceives <span class="sc">Sanguino</span>
with a Pistol.</i>]</span> but indeed, I found Sanguino an honest, good-natured
fellow too&mdash;
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>With increased terror.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> Hey, a bloody, wicked, honest, good-natured fellow! what
is all this?
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Yes; then, sir, I <i>thought</i> I saw these two

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>[34]</span>

                                                     gentlemen, and at
that instant, I <i>thought</i> they looked so terrible, that with the fright
I <i>awoke</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> Awoke! what the devil then, is all this but a dream you
have been telling me?
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Ay, sir, and the most frightful dream I ever had in my life.
I'm at this instant frightened out of my wits.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> You do look frightened indeed&mdash;poor man! I thought this
cave was&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Don't mention cave, or I faint&mdash;heigho!
</p>
<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Vasquez</span>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vas.</i> Dame Isabel wants to speak with you, sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> I'll wait on her.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Yes, I'll wait on her.
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Going hastily.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> You! she don't want you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Dear sir, she can't do without me at this time. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="sc">Scipio</span>.]</span>
I come.
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Going.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> No, you stay.&mdash;
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Pulls him back.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Ah, my dear captain. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Affecting surprise and joy.</i>]</span> What, and
my little Sanguino too! Who could have thought of your finding me out
here?
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> Yes, you are found out.
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Significantly.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Such discoveries as I have made in the castle!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> You're to make discoveries in the forest too.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> Our cave!
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Oh, you overheard that! Didn't I hum the old fellow finely?
Ha! ha! ha!
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> And for your reward, traitor, take this to your heart.
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Offers to stab him.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> Hold, Sanguino.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Nay, my dear Sanguino, stay! What the devil&mdash;So here I can't
run a jest upon a silly old man, but I must be run through with a
stilletto!
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> Come, Spado, confess what really brought you here.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Business, my dear sir, business; all in our own way too, for I
designed to let every man of you into the castle this very night, when
all the family are in bed, and plunder's the word&mdash;Oh, such a delicious
booty! pyramids of plate, bags of gold, and little chests of diamonds!
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> Indeed!
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Sanguino, look at the closet.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> Well!
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> A glorious prize!
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> Indeed!
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Six chests of massy plate! Look, only look into the closet;
wait here a moment, and I'll fetch a master key that shall open every
one of them.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don C&aelig;sar.</i> Hey! Let's see those chests.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> Massy plate! Quick, quick, the master key.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> I'll fetch it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sang.</i> Do but make haste, Spado.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> I will, my dear boy.

Fernando's portmanteau as a peace-offering for these two rascals! Are
you there? What a pity the coming of my fellow-rogues! I should have

<p>

<p>

is&mdash;But I wonder who could have brought it here.&mdash;Ay, ay, my fellow
servant Pedrillo is now too grand to mind his business;&mdash;and my master,
I find, though he has taken the habit, scorns the office of a
servant&mdash;So I must look after the things myself.
</p>
<p>

<p>

too.&mdash;But I think I'm far from a fool.

<p>

last night, I happened to sit down to a supper of only twelve covers,
cracked two bottles of choice wine, slept in an embroider'd bed, where
I sunk in down, and lay till this morning like a diamond in cotton.&mdash;So,
indeed, sir, I don't know what's the matter with me.

the whole family knows you're Don Fernando's footman.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> Am I faith? Ha! ha! ha! I'll humour this&mdash;Well then, my
dear, you know that I am only Don Fernando's footman?
</p>
<p>
<i>Catil.</i> Yes, yes, we know that, notwithstanding your fine clothes.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> But where's my master?
</p>
<p>
<i>Catil.</i> Don Fernando! he's parading the gallery yonder, in his sham
livery and morning gown.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> Oh, this accounts for twelve covers at supper and the
embroider'd bed; but who could have set such a jest going? I'll carry
it on though&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> So then after all I am known here?
</p>
<p>
<i>Catil.</i> Ay, and if all the impostors in the castle were as well known,
we shou'd have no wedding to-morrow night.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> Something else will out&mdash;I'll seem to be in the secret, and
perhaps may come at it&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Ay, ay, that piece of deceit is much
worse than ours.
</p>
<p>
<i>Catil.</i> That! what, then you know that this Italian lady is not Don
Scipio's daughter, but Dame Isabel's, and her true name Lorenza?
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> Here's a discovery! <span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> O yes, I know that.
</p>
<p>
<i>Catil.</i> You do! Perhaps you know too, that the young lady you saw me
speak with just now is the real Donna Victoria?
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> Is it possible! Here's a piece of villany! <span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Charming!
let me kiss you, my dear girl.

your assurance, I say&mdash;but I must about my business, can't play the
lady as you played the gentleman, I've something else to do; so I
desire you won't keep kissing me here all day.

scorn to think of the services I rendered him last night in the forest;

servant,&mdash;no, no; that dignity of deportment, and native elegance of
manner, can never be assumed; yonder he walks, and my fluttering heart
tells me this is really the amiable Fernando, that I must resign to
Dame Isabel's daughter.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> Stay, lovely Victoria!
</p>
<p>
<i>Vict.</i> Did you call me, sir?&mdash;Heavens, what have I said! <span class="dir-i">[<i>Confused.</i>]</span>
I mean, signor, would you wish to speak with Donna Victoria? I'll
inform her, sir.
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Going.</i>

<p>

charms, thus transfixed with wonder and delight.

<i>Vict.</i> Pray, signor, suffer me to withdraw.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> For worlds I would not offend! but think not, lady, 'tis the
knowledge of your quality that attracts my admiration.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vict.</i> Nay, signor.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> I know you to be Don Scipio's daughter, the innocent victim
of injustice and oppression; therefore I acknowledge to you, and you
alone, that, whatever you may have heard to the contrary, I really am
Fernando de Zelva.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Vict.</i> Signor, how you became acquainted with the secret of my birth I
know not; but, from an acquaintance so recent, your compliment I receive
as a mode of polite gallantry without a purpose.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> What your modesty regards as cold compliments, are sentiments
warm with the dearest purpose; I came hither to ratify a contract with
Don Scipio's daughter; you are she, the beautiful Victoria, destined for
the happy Fernando.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vict.</i> Pray rise, signor:&mdash;My father perhaps, even to himself, cannot
justify his conduct to me: But to censure that, or to pervert his
intentions, would, in me, be a breach of filial duty.

</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> Tell Pedrillo where you have left your master's portmanteau.
While I go lead him in triumph to his bride.
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Exit.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> Pray, my good, new, old friend, where has your care
deposited this portmanteau?
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Gone!
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Looking after <span class="sc">Don Scipio</span>.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> The portmanteau gone!
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Ay, his senses are quite gone.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> Where's the portmanteau that Don Scipio says you took
charge of?
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Portmanteau! Ah, the dear gentleman! Portmanteau did he say?
yes, yes, all's over with his poor brain; yesterday his head run upon
purses, and trumpeters, and the lord knows what; and to-day he talks of
dreamers, spies, and portmanteaus.&mdash;Yes, yes, his wits are going.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> It must be so; he talked to me last night and to-day of I
know not what, in a strange incoherent style.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Grief&mdash;all grief.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> If so, this whim of my being Pedrillo is, perhaps, the
creation of his own brain,&mdash;but then, how could it have run through
the whole family?&mdash;This is the first time I ever heard Don Scipio was
disordered in his mind.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Ay, we'd all wish to conceal it from your master, lest it
might induce him to break off the match, for I don't suppose he'd be
very ready to marry into a mad family.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> And pray, what are you, sir, in this mad family?
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Don Scipio's own gentleman, these ten years&mdash;Yet, you heard
him just now call me your fellow servant.&mdash;How you did stare when I
accosted you as an old acquaintance!&mdash;But we always humour him&mdash;I
should not have contradicted him, if he had said I was the pope's
nuncio.

<p>

advantage of his weakness.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> Another new whim of his,&mdash;he has taken a fancy, that every
body has got a ring from him, which, he imagines, belonged to his
deceased lady.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Fer.</i> True, he asked me something about a ring.
</p>
<p>

<i>Spado.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Apart to <span class="sc">Fernando</span>.</i>]</span> You see he's at the ring again.
</p>
<p>
<i>Don Scipio.</i> Come, let me have it, lad; I'll give you a better thing,
but that ring belonged to my deceased lady.
</p>
<p>
<i>Spado.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>To <span class="sc">Fernando</span>.</i>]</span> His deceased lady!&mdash;Ay, there's the touch.

<p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
